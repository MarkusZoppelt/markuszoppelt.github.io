I'm a software engineer at [Code Intelligence](https://www.code-intelligence.com/)
working on CLI fuzz testing tools and advancements in fuzzing.

My interests and skills are primarily in the field of security. I obtained my
PhD in Computer Science from FAU at the Chair of Applied Cryptography
([ChaAC](https://www.chaac.tf.fau.eu/)) on the topics of automotive security
and password hardened encryption services.
