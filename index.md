## Software Engineer

Hello! I am currently working as a software engineer at [Code Intelligence](https://www.code-intelligence.com/)
working on cli fuzz testing tools and fuzzing in general.
Before that, I worked as a security architect at Siemens for security & cryptography for embedded devices.
For a short time, I was also a cyber security consultant at Deloitte.

Before I joined those companies, I did my PhD in computer science at FAU at the 
Chair of Applied Cryptography ([ChaAC](https://www.chaac.tf.fau.eu/))
on the topics automotive security and password hardened encryption services.
