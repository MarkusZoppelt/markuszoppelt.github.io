## Software Engineer

Hello! I am currently working as a software engineer at [Code Intelligence](https://www.code-intelligence.com/)
working on cli fuzz testing tools and fuzzing in general.
Before that, I worked as a security architect at Siemens for security & cryptography for embedded devices.
For a short time, I was also a cyber security consultant at Deloitte.

Before I joined those companies, I did my PhD in computer science at FAU at the 
Chair of Applied Cryptography ([ChaAC](https://www.chaac.tf.fau.eu/))
on the topics automotive security and password hardened encryption services.
[Thesis](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/frontdoor/index/index/year/2021/docId/17344)

If you have my phone number, I strongly prefer to be contacted via Signal.
In other cases, please use my [PGP key](pubkey.asc) and send me an encrypted email
at [markus@zoppelt.net](mailto:%6Da%72kus@zoppelt.%6Eet).
